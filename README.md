## PROBLEM STATMENT
Problem Assignment ( Frontend )
Objective: To build a meme generator that allows users to insert custom text on meme images
fetched automatically.
Project Overview
Do you like memes? Most people do, so if yes, the idea of developing a meme generator would
surely get you going. You can build a simple meme generator that instantly allows users to
create memes in React.

The idea here is to use an API to fetch random meme images and then allow users to place
custom text at the top and bottom of the image.

Below is the basic idea:

You need to add two different input fields in your meme generator, i.e.:

1st one is for the text at the top and the

2nd one is for the text at the bottom of the image.

You can also create a database of your own to store meme images and fetch images from the
database.

Also, you can enhance the functionality of the meme generator by allowing users to create and
log in to their accounts, save memes, and share them on different social media platforms.
